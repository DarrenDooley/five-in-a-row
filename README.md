### Rules of the game:
   - Players take turns dropping x/o-shaped discs into a 6x9 grid.
   - A player wins if they form a line of 5 of their own discs.
   
 e.g.

   - If the grid fills up without a winner the game ends as a draw 
   
   e.g.

   - Maximum of 2 players can join a game.
   - Player 1 uses x-shaped discs.
   - Player 2 uses o-shaped discs.
   - x goes first.
   - State of the game is returned to the player after they make a move.
   - Players must input their own name and column number before each move.
   - Players can request the state of the game at any stage.
   - If a player leaves, the game ends and the other player wins.
   - If both players leave then the game restarts and new players may join.
 
 ### Simplifications:
   - A client was not built. Instead, the Swagger UI is used to emulate a client.
   - If player 1 makes a move then player 2 is not prompted for input. Player 2 must request the state in order to see the move made by player 1.
  
### Assumptions:
   - The application doesn't handle timeouts, therefore, it's assumed that the players will leave after the game ends.
   - It's assumed players will regularly request the state when waiting for an opponent to move.
